You are building a consulting-grade Proof of Concept, NOT a toy chatbot.

The application must convincingly demonstrate Agentic AI orchestration for a BFSI personal loan sales journey for an Indian NBFC, aligned with EY Techathon 6.0 – Problem Statement 2 (BFSI).

The output must be:

Architecturally sound

Business-realistic

Demo-ready

Jury-friendly

Visually premium

This project should look like something EY could show to a banking client.

🎯 BUSINESS GOAL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Build a web-based AI loan sales assistant that:

Engages customers conversationally (human-like sales)

Understands loan requirements

Performs KYC verification (mocked)

Performs underwriting using deterministic credit rules

Requests salary details only when required

Makes an approval or rejection decision

Generates a downloadable PDF sanction letter

Completes all of this inside a single chat session

🧠 ARCHITECTURAL PHILOSOPHY (MANDATORY)

Use Agentic AI

Follow Controller–Worker orchestration

Separate reasoning, business logic, and presentation

Treat underwriting as code, not AI opinion

Treat LLMs as assistants, not decision-makers

🏗️ TECH STACK (FIXED)
Backend

Python 3.10+

FastAPI

No microservices

No unnecessary frameworks

Modular folder structure

Frontend

Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no React)

Clean, responsive, modern

BFSI-grade UI polish

🤖 AGENT DEFINITIONS (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)
🧠 1. MASTER AGENT (ORCHESTRATOR)

Role

Single source of truth for the system

Owns conversation flow

Owns application state

Decides which worker agent to invoke

Interprets worker outputs

NEVER performs credit decisions itself

Capabilities

Uses an LLM ONLY for:

Natural conversation

User intent understanding

Professional phrasing

State Management
Maintain a persistent conversation state object:

{
  "session_id": "",
  "customer_name": "",
  "loan_amount": null,
  "tenure_months": null,
  "interest_rate": null,
  "credit_score": null,
  "salary": null,
  "emi": null,
  "pre_approved_limit": null,
  "kyc_verified": false,
  "underwriting_status": "pending",
  "final_decision": null
}


This state MUST be updated step-by-step.

💬 2. SALES AGENT (LLM-ASSISTED)

Purpose

Mimic a human loan sales executive

Ask relevant questions

Suggest reasonable loan options

Convince politely, not aggressively

Input

Partial conversation state

Output (STRICT JSON ONLY)

{
  "loan_amount": 400000,
  "tenure_months": 36,
  "interest_rate": 11.5
}


No free text allowed in output.

🪪 3. VERIFICATION AGENT (LOGIC ONLY)

Purpose

Simulate KYC verification

Fetch customer profile from a dummy CRM

Implementation

Use a mock database/dictionary

Deterministic responses

Output

{
  "phone_verified": true,
  "address_verified": true,
  "pre_approved_limit": 300000
}

📊 4. UNDERWRITING AGENT (ZERO AI, PURE LOGIC)

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AGENT

Rules (IMPLEMENT EXACTLY):

If credit_score < 700 → REJECT

If loan_amount ≤ pre_approved_limit → APPROVE

If loan_amount ≤ 2 × pre_approved_limit:

Request salary

Calculate EMI

Approve ONLY if EMI ≤ 50% of salary

If loan_amount > 2 × pre_approved_limit → REJECT

Output

{
  "decision": "approved",
  "reason": "Within pre-approved limit",
  "emi": 14500
}


No LLM usage allowed here.

📄 5. SANCTION LETTER AGENT

Purpose

Generate a professional PDF sanction letter

PDF MUST INCLUDE

NBFC name (fictional)

Customer name

Loan amount

Tenure

Interest rate

EMI

Approval date

Disclaimer text

Style

Formal

Corporate

Looks like a real bank document

🔁 ORCHESTRATION FLOW (STRICT)

User opens chatbot

Master Agent greets user

Sales Agent gathers loan needs

Verification Agent validates KYC

Underwriting Agent evaluates eligibility

Salary requested ONLY if needed

Final decision communicated

Sanction letter generated

Download link shown in chat

Conversation closed professionally

NO parallel chaos.
ONE clean, deterministic flow.
